                <p class="py-4">Hi baby. I don't know where to begin. Our relationship has been full of such unique highs and lows. We are by no means a normal couple but I am 
                    so happy and grateful for what we are and what we've been through. If our past is not testament enough, I want to remind you that no matter what we face, 
                    we're going to pull through. I've already thanked you for being there for me a million times. But I want to be more specific this time. 
                    Thank you so much for standing by my side when I need you the most. Everytime I hate myself and lose myself to my thoughts you pick me up and never leave me. 
                    <b>I am forever grateful for that.</b> You come to all my volleyball games and love to watch me perform. You have no idea how much this means to me and <b>I am forever grateful for that.</b> 
                    You are a constant reminder to me that there is more to this world, more to hapiness, than just a job and money. <b>I am forever grateful for that.</b>
                     And lastly, love, you remind me that there is always something in the future to look forward to. <b>I am forever grateful for you.</b></p>
